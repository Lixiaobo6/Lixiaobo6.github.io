Learning focus: 
1. Basic concepts of Git: 
 Repository: A place to store project code and history. 
 Working Directory: The code directory currently being edited. 
 Staging Area: Temporarily save changes to be submitted. 
* Commit: Save changes in the staging area to the repository and generate a unique version number. 
 Branch: An independent code line used to develop new features or fix bugs. 
 Merge: Merge code from different branches together. 

1. Basic commands of Git: 
 git init: Initialize a Git repository. 
 git add: Add files to the staging area. 
 git commit: Commit changes to the repository. 
 git status: View the status of the current working area and staging area. 
 git log: View the commit history. 
 git branch: View, create or delete branches. 
 git checkout: switch branches or restore files. 
 git merge: merge branches. 

Learning experience: 
Git is one of the essential skills for programmers. Learning Git can help me better manage code versions and improve team collaboration efficiency. Today's learning gave me a preliminary understanding of the basic concepts and operations of Git. Next, I need to consolidate what I have learned through practice.

Next plan:
1. Create a Git repository locally and try to use basic commands for version control. 
2. Learn how to use code hosting platforms such as GitHub for remote collaboration. 
3. In-depth study of advanced features of Git, such as rebase, stash, etc.
