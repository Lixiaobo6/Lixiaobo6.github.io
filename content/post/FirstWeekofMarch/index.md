This week, I mainly studied differential calculus in mathematical analysis, vector space in linear algebra, and basic operations of Linux system. The study of differential calculus helped me understand its geometric meaning and application value. Although the abstract concepts of linear algebra were somewhat challenging, I gradually mastered the core ideas of vector space and basis. The command line operation of Linux made me feel efficient and flexible, and the file permission management also gave me a deeper understanding of the system.
